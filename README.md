# Bitcoin-Small-Class-Number-Attack
Trump defunded my math PhD, now I identify as an internet math autist while I figure things out.

## For Absolute Beginners (no math background, non-technical)
We use imaginary numbers to attack imaginary internet money.

## For STEM guys (moderate math background, technical)
Satoshi chose an elliptic curve with a bizarre prime number. It splits *extremely* well over √-3. 
There are nine special square roots of imaginary numbers, called Heegner numbers, and math researchers have long speculated the possibility of this attack.

## Super Technical (moderate math background, technical)
We *attempt* an attack on secp256k1's field characteristic over both of it's unique factorization domains, the regular integers and the ring of Eisenstein integers.
This is experimental mathematics and our tests involve:
1. Finding an Eisenstein integer somewhat similar to the fundamental solution of the Pell equation as we saw here.
2. A Xedni calculus approach that leverages the fact that Hyperbolas encode an elliptic curve's addition property.
3. Division polynomials encode elliptic curve information and permit multiplication. We can exploit the factorization of p-1.

Here's our thesis: if we f around then we shall find out. All we need are the field characteristic's logarithms to get started.
