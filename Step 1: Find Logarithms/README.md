# Step 1: Collect Logarithms


So we must roll our own relation collector for the index calculus step.

We exploit the fact that Bitcoin's prime splits over the ring of Eisenstein integers to find smooth numbers over the reals and the complex.

I go through the code and the math in this LeetArxiv paper on Gaussian and Eisenstein integers.

Here's my reading list if you're an absolute beginner.

1. The Ds

I tried using CADO-NFS but it doesn't work for this prime number DLP. Could be a skill issue on my end.
